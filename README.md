## ðŸš€ What Does This Repo Do?

- **Purpose:**
  - This repository contains a Node.js script and GitHub Actions workflow that regularly cleans up (deletes) files stored in the Supabase Storage bucket by any user on the SATI ChatBot website above.
  - It ensures that user-uploaded files are only kept for a short, defined period, helping manage storage costs and privacy.

- **How it works:**
  - Files uploaded by users are named with a timestamp.
  - The cleanup script runs every minute (via GitHub Actions) and deletes files that have reached their scheduled deletion time (the next 5-minute mark after upload).
